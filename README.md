# Breast Cancer Prediction App
# Overview
This repository contains a Streamlit web application designed to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on medical diagnostic details. The application uses a TensorFlow Keras model to analyze diagnostic data and predict the likelihood of breast cancer.

# Features
Intuitive Interface: The app provides an easy-to-navigate interface for inputting diagnostic details.
Detailed Input Fields: Users can input specific medical diagnostic features, which the app uses to make predictions.
Instant Prediction: Upon entering the details, the app quickly predicts whether the diagnosis is benign or malignant.
Visual Feedback: Depending on the prediction, the app displays a corresponding image and message to convey the results clearly.

# Model Information
Model Type: The app uses a Neural Network model, specifically designed to identify patterns that may indicate malignant tumors.
Purpose: The model aims to provide a preliminary assessment and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

# How to Use
Start the app and use the sidebar to enter the diagnostic features.
Each feature has an input field, allowing for precise data entry.
After entering the data, click 'Predict Diagnosis' for the result.
The app will indicate whether the diagnosis points towards a benign or malignant condition.

# Important Note
This application is a technological demonstration and should not replace professional medical advice. Always consult with healthcare professionals for accurate diagnoses and medical guidance.
